YouTube Demo: https://youtu.be/1lK29jInRJY

**Desc:** The purpose of this project is to transform business rules into a database system using Postgres

**Phase 1:** 
- Normalization process
- Connecting entities with M:M relationships (and resolving through bridge tables)
- Labelling PKs and FKs, constraints  
- Designed Conceptual, Logical, Physical models in Software Ideas Modeller
  
**Phase 2:** 
- SQL files which use CREATE TABLE to make tables following the Physical model
- Generated sample data (.csv) using ChatGPT (5000 students, 40 credentials, 200 courses)
- Implemented a Python file which pulls the sample data and populates existing tables
- Using PostgreSQL

**Phase 3:**
- Created 8 SQL files that manipulate existing tables into reports
- Each is given a reason/purpose for the report
- SQL Concepts: Joins, single-row functions, restricting/sorting, grouping, OLAP, subqueries
